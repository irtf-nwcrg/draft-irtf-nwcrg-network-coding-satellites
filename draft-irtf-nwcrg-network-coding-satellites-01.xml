	<section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">
        <t>Guaranteeing both physical layer robustness and efficient usage of the radio resource has been in the core design of SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM) systems. The trade-off often resided in how much redundancy a system had to add to cope from link impairments, without reducing the good-put when the channel quality is high. Generally speaking, enough redundancy is added so as to guarantee a Quasi-Error Free transmission; however, there are cases where the physical layer could hardly recover the transmission losses (e.g. with a mobile user) and layer 2 (or above) re-transmissions induce an at least 500 ms delay with a geostationary satellite. Further exploiting network coding schemes at higher OSI-layers is an opportunity for releasing constraints on the physical layer and improving the performance of SATCOM systems when the physical layer is challenged. We have noticed an active research activity on how network coding and SATCOM in the past. That being said, not much has actually made it to industrial developments. In this context, this memo aims at:</t>

        <section anchor="sec:sat_topo" title="A note on satellite topology">
        <t>The objective of this section is to provide both a generic description of the components composing a generic satellite system and their interaction. It provides a high level description of a multi-gateway satellites network. There exist multiple SATCOM systems, such as those dedicated to broadcasting TV or to IoT applications: depending on the purpose of the SATCOM system, ground segments are specific. This memo lays on SATCOM systems dedicated to Internet access that follows the DVB-S2/RCS2 standards. In this context, the increase of the available capacity that is carried out to end users and the need for reliability results in the need for multiple gateways for one unique satellite platform.</t>
        <t>In this context, <xref target="fig:sat_gateway"></xref> shows an example of a multi-gateway satellite system. More details on a generic SATCOM ground segment architecture for a bi-directional Internet access can be found in <xref target="SAT2017"></xref>. We propose a multi-gateway system since some of the use-cases described in this document require multiple gateways. In a multi-gateway system, some elements may be centralized and/or gathered: the relevance of one approach compared to another depends on the deployment scenario. More information on these trade-off discussions can be found in <xref target="SAT2017"></xref>.</t> 
        <t>It is worth noting that some functional blocks aggregate the traffic coming from multiple users. Even if network coding schemes could be applied to any individual traffic, it could also work on an aggregate.</t>

        <t> </t>
	<t><xref target="fig:existing_network"></xref> presents the status of the network coding deployment in satellite systems. The information is based on the taxonomy document <xref target="RFC8406"> </xref> and the notations are the following: End-to-End Coding (E2E), Network Coding (NC), Intra-Flow Coding (IntraF), Inter-Flow Coding (InterF), Single-Path Coding (SP)  and Multi-Path Coding (MP).</t>
        <t>X1 embodies the source coding that could be used at application level for instance: for video streaming on a broadband access. X2 embodies the physical layer, applied to the PLFRAME, to optimize the satellite capacity usage. Furthermore, at the physical layer and when random accesses are exploited, FEC mechanisms are exploited. It is worth pointing out that NC is an inherent part of the physical layer of satellite systems, but based on public information, NC does not seem to be widely used at higher OSI layers.</t>

        <t>This section details use-cases where network coding schemes could improve the overall performance of a SATCOM system (e.g. considering a more efficient usage of the satellite resource, delivery delay, delivery ratio).</t>
        <t>It is worth noting that these use-cases focus more on the middleware (e.g. aggregation nodes) and packetization UDP/IP of <xref target="fig:existing_network"></xref>. Indeed, there are already lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical and access layers in currently deployed systems while E2E source coding are done at the application level. In a multi-gateway SATCOM Internet access, the specific opportunities are more relevant in specific SATCOM components such as the "network function" block or the "access gateway" of <xref target="fig:sat_gateway"></xref>.</t> 

       	<section anchor="subsec:two-way" title="Two way relay channel mode">
	<t>This use-case considers a two-way communication between end users, through a satellite link. We propose an illustration of this scenario in <xref target="fig:two_way"></xref>.</t>
        <t>Satellite terminal A (resp. B) transmits a flow A (resp. B) to a server hosting NC capabilities, which forward a combination of the two flows to both terminals. This results in non-negligible bandwidth saving and has been demonstrated at ASMS 2010 in Cagliari <xref target="ASMS2010"></xref>. Moreover, with On-Board Processing satellite payloads, the network coding operations could be done at the satellite level, thus reducing the end-to-end delay of the communication.</t>

	<t>This use-case considers adding redundancy to a multicast flow depending on what has been received by different end-users, resulting in non-negligible scarce resource saving. We propose an illustration for this scenario in <xref target="fig:rel_multi"></xref>.</t>

	<t>A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and B. However packet Ni (resp. Nj) get lost at terminal A (resp. B), and terminal A (resp. B) returns a negative acknowledgement Li (resp. Lj), indicating that the packet is missing. Then either the access gateway or the multicast server includes a repair packet (rather than the individual Ni and Nj packets) in the multicast flow to let both terminals recover from losses. This could be achieved by using NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) <xref target="RFC5740"></xref> in situations where a feedback is possible and desirable, or FLUTE/ALC <xref target ="RFC6726"></xref> when it is not the case. Note that currently both NORM nor FLUTE/ALC are limited to block coding, none of them supporting sliding window encoding schemes <xref target="RFC8406"></xref>.</t>

       	<section anchor="subsec:varying" title="Dealing with varying capacity">
	<t>This use-case considers the usage of network coding to overcome cases where the wireless link characteristics quickly change overtime and where the physical layer codes could not be made robust in time. This is particularly relevant when end users are moving and the channel shows important variations <xref target="IEEEVT2001"></xref>.</t>
	<t>The architecture is recalled in <xref target="fig:varying_capa"></xref>. In these cases, Adaptative Coding and Modulation (ACM) may not adapt the modulation and coding accordingly and remaining errors could be recovered with higher layers redundancy packets. The network coding schemes could be applied at the access gateway or the network function block levels to increase the reliability of the transmission. This use-case is mostly relevant for when mobile users are considered or when the chosen band induce a required physical layer coding that may change over time (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.). Depending on the use-case (e.g. very high frequency bands, mobile users) or depending on the deployment use-cases (e.g. performance of the network between each individual block), the relevance of adding network coding is different. Then, depending on the OSI level at which network coding is applied, the impact on the satellite terminal is different: network coding may be applied on IP packets or on layer-2 proprietary format packets.</t>

	<t>This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost during gateway handovers. Whether this is for off-loading one given equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant. However, if gateways are not properly synchronized, this may result in packet loss. During these critical phases, network coding can be added to improve the reliability of the transmission and propose a seamless gateway handover. In this case, the network coding could be applied at either the access gateway or the network function block. The entity responsible for taking the decision to change the communication gateway and changing the routes is the control plane manager; this entity exploits a management interface.</t>
	<t>An example architecture for this use-case is showed in <xref target="fig:gat_hand"></xref>. It is worth noting that depending on the ground architecture <xref target="I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang"></xref> <xref target="SAT2017"></xref>, some equipment might be communalised.</t>

	<section anchor="subsec:dtn" title="Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks">
	<t>Establishing communications from terrestrial gateways to aerospace components is a challenge due to the distances involved. As a matter of fact, reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such links must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking <xref target="RFC4838"></xref> is a solution to enable reliable internetworking space communications where both standard ad-hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used. DTN can also be seen as an alternative solution to cope with satellite communications usually managed by PEP. Therefore, the transport of data over such networks requires the use of replication, erasure codes and multipath protocol schemes <xref target="WANG05"></xref> <xref target="ZHANG06"></xref> to improve the bundle delivery ratio and/or delivery delay. For instance, transport protocols such as LTP <xref target="RFC5326"></xref> for long delay links with connectivity disruptions, use Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) and unequal error protection to reduce the amount of non-mandatory re-transmissions. The work in <xref target="TOURNOUX10"></xref> proposed upon LTP a robust streaming method based on an on-the-fly coding scheme, where encoding and decoding procedures are done at the source and destination nodes, respectively. However, each link path loss rate may have various order of magnitude and re-encoding at an intermediate node to adapt the redundancy can be mandatory to prevent transmission wasting. This idea has been put forward in <xref target="I-D.zinky-dtnrg-random-binary-fec-scheme"></xref> and <xref target="I-D.zinky-dtnrg-erasure-coding-extension"></xref>, where the authors proposed an encoding process at intermediate DTN nodes to explore the possibilities of Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes inside the bundle protocol <xref target="RFC5050"></xref>.
Another proposal is the use of erasure coding inside the CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) architecture <xref target="COLA11"></xref>.
The objective is to extend the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) <xref target="CCSDS-FDP"></xref> with erasure coding capabilities where a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) <xref target="RFC6816"></xref> code with a large block size is chosen. 
Recently, on-the-fly erasure coding schemes <xref target="LACAN08"></xref> <xref target="SUNDARARAJAN08"></xref> <xref target="TOURNOUX11"></xref> have shown their benefits in terms of recovery capability and configuration complexity compared to traditional FEC schemes. Using a feedback path when available, on-the-fly schemes can be used to enable E2E reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-encoding as proposed in <xref target="THAI15"></xref>.

	<section anchor="sec:deploy_deployability" title="Deployability in current SATCOM systems">
	<t>SATCOM systems typically feature Performance Enhancement Proxy <xref target="RFC3135">RFC&nbsp;3135</xref> which could be relevant to host network coding mechanisms and thus support the use-cases that have been discussed in <xref target="sec:use_cases"></xref>. PEP usually split TCP end-to-end connections and forward TCP packets to the satellite baseband gateway that deals with layer 2 and layer 1 encapsulations. Deploying network coding schemes at the TCP level in these equipments could be relevant and independent from the specificities of a SATCOM link. That being said, we can notice a research issue in the recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems that is related to the amount of reliability that you introduce in the first transmission to guarantee a better end-user QoE and the usage of the scarce resource.</t>

	<section anchor="sec:deploy_nfv" title="Interaction with virtualization">
	<t>Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, the network coding schemes could be proposed as Virtual Network Function (VNF) and their deployability enhanced. The architecture for the next generation of SATCOM ground segments would rely on a virtualized environment. This trend can also be seen, making the discussions on the deployability of network coding in SATCOM extendable to other deployment scenarios <xref target="I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang"> </xref>. As one example, the network coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized environment is presented in <xref target="I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization"> </xref>. A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other SATCOM specific functions, to guarantee an efficient radio resource utilization and easy to deploy SATCOM services.</t>

        <t>This document presents the current deployment of network coding in some satellite telecommunications systems along with a discussion on the multiple opportunities to introduce these techniques at a wider scale.</t>
 
        <t>Even if this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth pointing out that the some scenarios proposed may be relevant to other wireless telecommunication systems. As one example, the generic architecture proposed in <xref target="fig:sat_gateway"></xref> may be mapped to cellular networks as follows: the 'network function' block gather some of the functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network. This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this draft since they may be also relevant for cellular networks.</t>

	<t>Security considerations are inherent to any access network. SATCOM systems introduce standard security mechanisms. In particular, there are some specificities related to the fact that all users under the coverage can record all the packets that are being transmitted, such as in LTE networks. On the specific scenario of NC in SATCOM systems, there are no specific security considerations.<!--See <xref target="RFC3552">RFC 3552</xref> for a guide.--></t>
