	<section anchor="sec:introduction" title="Introduction">
     	<t>Guaranteeing both physical-layer robustness and efficient usage of the radio resource has been in the core design of SATellite COMmunication (SATCOM) systems. The trade-off often resided in how much redundancy a system adds to cope from link impairments, without reducing the good-put when the channel quality is good. There is usually enough redundancy to guarantee a Quasi-Error Free transmission. The recovery time depends on the encoding block size. Considering for instance geostationary satellite system (GEO), physical or link layers erasure coding mechanisms recover transmission losses within a negligible delay compared to link delay. However, when retransmissions are triggered, this leads to an non-negligible additional delay in particular over GEO link. Further exploiting coding schemes at application or transport layers is an opportunity for releasing constraints on the physical layer and improving the performance of SATCOM systems.</t>
	<t>We notice an active research activity on coding and SATCOM. That being said, not much has actually made it to industrial developments. In this context, this document aims at identifying opportunities for further usage of coding in these systems.</t>

        <section anchor="sec:sat_topo" title="A note on satellite topology">
        <t>This section describes the components in a satellite system based on SATCOM systems dedicated to broadband Internet access that follows the DVB standards. A high-level description of a multi-gateway satellite network is provided. There are multiple SATCOM systems, such as those dedicated to broadcasting TV or to IoT applications: depending on the purpose of the SATCOM system, ground segments are specific. In this context, the increase of the available capacity that is carried out to end users and reliability requirements lead to multiple gateways for one unique satellite platform.</t>
        <t>In this context, <xref target="fig:sat_gateway"></xref> shows an example of a multi-gateway satellite system. In a multi-gateway system, some elements may be centralized and/or gathered: the relevance of one approach compared to another depends on the deployment scenario. More information on these discussions and a generic SATCOM ground segment architecture for a bi-directional Internet access can be found in <xref target="SAT2017"></xref>.</t> 
        <t>Some functional blocks aggregate the traffic of multiple users. Coding schemes could be applied on both single and aggregated traffic.</t>

        <t>This section details use-cases where coding schemes could improve the overall performance of a SATCOM system (e.g. considering a more efficient usage of the satellite resource, delivery delay, delivery ratio).</t>
        <t>It is worth noting that these use-cases mostly focus on the middleware and packetization UDP/IP of <xref target="fig:existing_network"></xref>. There are already lots of recovery mechanisms at the physical-layer in currently deployed systems while E2E source coding is done at the application level. In a multi-gateway SATCOM Internet access, the deployment opportunities are more relevant in specific SATCOM components such as the "network function" block or the "access gateway" of <xref target="fig:sat_gateway"></xref>.</t>

	<t>A multicast flow (M) is forwarded to both satellite terminals A and B. However packet Ni (resp. Nj) gets lost at terminal A (resp. B), and terminal A (resp. B) returns a negative acknowledgment Li (resp. Lj), indicating that the packet is missing. Then either the access gateway or the multicast server includes a repair packet (rather than the individual Ni and Nj packets) in the multicast flow to let both terminals recover from losses. This could be achieved by using NACK-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) <xref target="RFC5740"></xref> in situations where a feedback link is available, or File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE) <xref target ="RFC6726"></xref> otherwise. Note that both NORM and FLUTE are limited to block coding, none of them supporting sliding window encoding schemes <xref target="RFC8406"></xref>. Note that although FLUTE is defined as an unidirectional protocol, the RFC proposes a bidirectional communication method to enable full reliability transfer and for security purpose.</t>

	<t>This use-case considers the usage of coding to cope with cases where channel condition can change in less than a second and where the physical-layer codes could not guarantee a Quasi-Error-Free (QEF) transmission.</t>
	<t>The architecture is recalled in <xref target="fig:varying_capa"></xref>. In these cases, Adaptative Coding and Modulation (ACM) may not adapt the modulation and coding accordingly and remaining errors could be recovered with higher layers redundancy packets. The coding schemes could be applied at the access gateway or the network function block levels to increase the reliability of the transmission. Coding may be applied on IP packets or on layer-2 proprietary format packets.</t>
	<t>This use-case is mostly relevant for when mobile users are considered or when the chosen band induce a required physical-layer coding that may change over time (Q/V bands, Ka band, etc.). Depending on the use-case (e.g. very high frequency bands, mobile users) or depending on the deployment use-cases (e.g. performance of the network between each individual block), the relevance of adding coding is different.</t>

       	<section anchor="subsec:gat_hand" title="Improving the gateway handovers">
	<t>This use-case considers the recovery of packets that may be lost during gateway handovers. Whether this is for off-loading one given equipment or because the transmission quality is not the same on each gateway, changing the transmission gateway may be relevant. However, if gateways are not properly synchronized, this may result in packet loss. During these critical phases, coding can be added to improve the reliability of the transmission and allow a seamless gateway handover. Coding could be applied at either the access gateway or the network function block. The control plane manager is in charge of taking the decision to change the communication gateway and the consequent routes.</t>
	<t><xref target="fig:gat_hand"></xref> illustrates this use-case. Depending on the ground architecture <xref target="I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang"></xref> <xref target="SAT2017"></xref>, some equipment might be communalised.</t>

	<section anchor="sec:deploy_deployability" title="Towards an increased deployability in SATCOM systems">
	<t>SATCOM systems typically feature Performance Enhancement Proxy (PEP) <xref target="RFC3135">RFC&nbsp;3135</xref>. PEP usually split TCP end-to-end connections and forward TCP packets to the satellite baseband gateway that deals with layer-2 and layer-1 encapsulations. PEP could host coding mechanisms and thus support the use-cases that have been discussed in this document.</t>
	<t>Deploying coding schemes at the TCP level in these equipment could be relevant and independent from the specific characteristics of a SATCOM link. However, there is a research issue in the recurrent trade-off in SATCOM systems: how much overhead from redundant reliability packets can be introduced to guarantee a better end-user QoE while optimizing capacity usage ?</t>
	</section>
	
	<section anchor="sec:deploy_nfv" title="Interaction with virtualized satellite gateways and terminals">
	<t>Related to the foreseen virtualized network infrastructure, coding schemes could be easily deployed as VNF. Next generation of SATCOM ground segments could rely on a virtualized environment. This trend can also be seen in cellular networks, making these discussions extendable to other deployment scenarios <xref target="I-D.chin-nfvrg-cloud-5g-core-structure-yang"> </xref>. As one example, the coding VNF functions deployment in a virtualized environment is presented in <xref target="I-D.vazquez-nfvrg-netcod-function-virtualization"> </xref>.</t>
	<t>A research challenge would be the optimization of the NFV service function chaining, considering a virtualized infrastructure and other SATCOM specific functions, to guarantee an efficient radio usage and easy-to-deploy SATCOM services. Moreover, another challenge related to a virtualized SATCOM terminals is the management of limited buffered equipments.</t>

<!--	<t>In the context of deep-space communications, establishing communications from terrestrial gateways to satellite platforms can be a challenge. Indeed, reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such links must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking <xref target="RFC4838"></xref> is a solution to enable reliable internetworking space communications where both standard ad-hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used. The transport of data over such networks requires the use of replication, erasure codes and multipath protocol schemes <xref target="WANG05"></xref> <xref target="ZHANG06"></xref> to improve the bundle delivery ratio and/or delivery delay. For instance, transport protocols such as LTP <xref target="RFC5326"></xref> for long delay links with connectivity disruptions, use Automatic Repeat-reQuest (ARQ) and unequal error protection to reduce the amount of non-mandatory re-transmissions. The work in <xref target="TOURNOUX10"></xref> proposed upon LTP a robust streaming method based on an on-the-fly coding scheme, where encoding and decoding procedures are done at the source and destination nodes, respectively. However, each link path loss rate may have various order of magnitude and re-encoding at an intermediate node to adapt the redundancy can be mandatory to prevent transmission wasting. This idea has been put forward in <xref target="I-D.zinky-dtnrg-random-binary-fec-scheme"></xref> and <xref target="I-D.zinky-dtnrg-erasure-coding-extension"></xref>, where the authors proposed an encoding process at intermediate DTN nodes to explore the possibilities of Forward Error Correction (FEC) schemes inside the bundle protocol <xref target="RFC5050"></xref>. In this context, the use of erasure coding inside a Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) architecture has been specified in <xref target="CCSDS-131.5-O-1"></xref>.</t> -->

	<t>In the context of the deep-space communications, establishing communications from terrestrial gateways to satellite platforms can be a challenge. Reliable end-to-end (E2E) communications over such links must cope with long delay and frequent link disruptions. Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking <xref target="RFC4838"></xref> is a solution to enable reliable internetworking space communications where both standard ad-hoc routing and E2E Internet protocols cannot be used. Moreover, DTN can also be seen as an alternative solution to transfer the data between a central PEP and a remote PEP.</t>
	<t>Coding enables E2E reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-encoding, as proposed in <xref target="THAI15"></xref>. In this case, the use-cases proposed in <xref target="subsec:varying"></xref> would legitimize the usage of coding within the DTN stack to improve the channel utilization and the E2E transmission delay. In this context, the use of erasure coding inside a Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) architecture has been specified in <xref target="CCSDS-131.5-O-1"></xref>. A research challenge would be on how such coding can be integrated in the IETF DTN stack.</t>

<!-- The objective is to extend the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol (CFDP) <xref target="CCSDS-FDP"></xref> with erasure coding capabilities where a Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) <xref target="RFC6816"></xref> code with a large block size is chosen. Recently, on-the-fly erasure coding schemes <xref target="LACAN08"></xref> <xref target="SUNDARARAJAN08"></xref> <xref target="TOURNOUX11"></xref> have shown their benefits in terms of recovery capability and configuration complexity compared to traditional FEC schemes. Using a feedback path when available, on-the-fly schemes can be used to enable E2E reliable communication over DTN with adaptive re-encoding as proposed in <xref target="THAI15"></xref>. -->

        <t>This document discuses some opportunities to introduce these techniques at a wider scale in satellite telecommunications systems.</t>
 
        <t>Even though this document focuses on satellite systems, it is worth pointing out that some scenarios proposed may be relevant to other wireless telecommunication systems. As one example, the generic architecture proposed in <xref target="fig:sat_gateway"></xref> may be mapped to cellular networks as follows: the 'network function' block gather some of the functions of the Evolved Packet Core subsystem, while the 'access gateway' and 'physical gateway' blocks gather the same type of functions as the Universal Mobile Terrestrial Radio Access Network. This mapping extends the opportunities identified in this draft since they may be also relevant for cellular networks.</t>

	<section anchor="sec:ecurity" title="Security Considerations">
	<t>Security considerations are inherent to any access network, and in particular SATCOM systems. The use of FEC or Network Coding in SATCOM also comes with risks (e.g., a single corrupted redundant packet may propagate to several flows when they are protected togething in an Inter-Flow coding approach, see section <xref target="sec:use_cases"></xref>). However this is not specific to the SATCOM use-case and this document does not further elaborate on it.</t>
